# Abstract

Hyperloop Preliminary Design Study Technical Section

Existing conventional modes of transportation of people consists of four unique types: rail, road, water, and air.
These modes of transport tend to be either relatively slow (e.g., road and water), expensive (e.g., air), or a
combination of relatively slow and expensive (i.e., rail). Hyperloop is a new mode of transport that seeks to
change this paradigm by being both fast and inexpensive for people and goods. Hyperloop is also unique in that
it is an open design concept, similar to Linux. Feedback is desired from the community that can help advance
the Hyperloop design and bring it from concept to reality.

Hyperloop consists of a low pressure tube with capsules that are transported at both low and high speeds
throughout the length of the tube. The capsules are supported on a cushion of air, featuring pressurized air
and aerodynamic lift. The capsules are accelerated via a magnetic linear accelerator affixed at various stations
on the low pressure tube with rotors contained in each capsule. Passengers may enter and exit Hyperloop at
stations located either at the ends of the tube, or branches along the tube length.

In this study, the initial route, preliminary design, and logistics of the Hyperloop transportation system have
been derived. The system consists of capsules that travel between Los Angeles, California and San Francisco,
California. The total one-way trip time is 35 minutes from county line to county line. The capsules leave on
average every 2 minutes from each terminal carrying 28 people each (as often as every 30 seconds during rush
hour and less frequently at night). This gives a total of 7.4 million people per tube that can be transported
each year on Hyperloop. The total cost of Hyperloop is under $6 billion USD for two one-way tubes and 40 capsules.
Amortizing this capital cost over 20 years and adding daily operational costs gives a total of $20 USD plus
operating costs per one-way ticket on the passenger Hyperloop.
